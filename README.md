# working-with-VPNs 

## 📌 Objective  
Understand the role of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in protecting privacy and ensuring secure communication.  

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- ProtonVPN (Free Tier)  
- [WhatIsMyIPAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com/)  

## 🚀 Steps Performed  
1. Created a free ProtonVPN account.  
2. Installed and set up the ProtonVPN client.  
3. Connected to a server located in **Japan**.  
4. Verified IP change using whatismyipaddress.com.  
5. Confirmed encrypted traffic by browsing websites.  
6. Disconnected and compared browsing speed (VPN vs non-VPN).  

## 📊 Findings  
- ✅ VPN masked real IP and showed a new location.  
- 🔒 Encrypted internet traffic, preventing ISP/third-party tracking.  
- 🐢 Browsing speed was slower when connected to VPN.  
- ⚠️ Free VPN had limitations like restricted servers and possible throttling.  

## 📌 Conclusion  
VPNs are effective for securing online privacy and anonymity. They encrypt data, mask IP addresses, and prevent tracking. However, free VPNs may have speed, bandwidth, and server restrictions. Premium VPNs provide better performance and reliability.
